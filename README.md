A map used to display all the wonderful characters that live in the bike lanes and bike ways of Portland, Oregon.
Feel free to use the issues tab to suggest general site changes, or to inform me about characters that may have been missed (or submit them yourselves (see below))!

## Cloning the project

This repo has a sub-module for the image optimization, so if you're gonna be adding characters, be sure to clone like so:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/TNorbury/bike-character-map.git
```


## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

## Guidelines for taking a good image

This is less about photographic theory and more about creating a image that displays a bikeway character good (and is also consistent with other ones on the website). At an absolute minimum shoot the image in a portrait orientation. I'd recommend standing about half and foot or so behind the character and holding your phone (or whatever camera you're using) with outstretched hands and aiming the lens about downwards at ~45Â° angle. The image below demonstrates what a "pretty good" character picture look like
